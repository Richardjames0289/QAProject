o	Why are we doing this?
The purpose of this project is to create an api that can use CRUD functionality with a h2/SQL database using postman.

o	How I expected the challenge to go.
I expect challenges in the testing section as I still need to learn some of it. Similarly trying to understand 
when an error is a bug as oppose to a coding issue.

o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The initial start of the project went well. My biggest unforseen erros were actually sloppyness in the saving of
the app that caused several complications in github. I accidently saved to main and had to revert the branch,
which in turn cause the dev branch to change colour. I similarly later on hit a block where my github was correct
but my laptop was all jumbled that led me to needing to clone my project back.
There was a difficult problem in using a domain with multiple words when connecting to H2 aswell as h2 seperates
the words with under-scores instead of by camel case which led to several complications.

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
The main improvements I can think about, I still need to implement such as condensing the code via use of functions
such as lombok. However, I know from before that eclipse seemed to not like the imports and refuse to work.

o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.

I Experienced serveral merge conflicts when merging my final dev branch into main. To overcome these, I ended up
resolving the merge conflicts locally before pushing them up to github as it could not resolve them on the site.
